Vehicle Rental System â€“ University Project (SE1020 OOP Module)


A full-featured JSP-based web application developed as part of a university coursework project to manage vehicle rentals. Built using Java, Servlets, and JSP, the system supports both user and admin functionalities, including user management, vehicle listings, booking processing, package handling, ratings, and availability tracking.

âœ… The system is developed entirely using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including:

Encapsulation â€“ All core entities use private fields with public getters/setters

Abstraction â€“ Business logic and file handling are abstracted in controller/manager classes

Inheritance â€“ Shared class hierarchies for roles (e.g., User, Admin)

Polymorphism â€“ Overridden methods across management classes for flexible behavior

Composition â€“ Relationships between vehicles, bookings, and users modeled using composition

Modularity & Reusability â€“ Separated concerns between data models, servlets, managers, and JSP views

ðŸ“‚ Data stored in .txt files using list/queue-based managers (no database)
ðŸŽ¨ Frontend styled with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive user experience
ðŸ§  Perfect for learning JSP-based system design, file-handling logic, and implementing complete CRUD operations in a real-world OOP project

ðŸ”— Developed collaboratively by a 6-member team using GitHub for version control and Apache Tomcat for deployment
